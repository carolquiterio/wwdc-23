#  VeggieRecipe

## Hello! My name is Carolina Quiterio and I'm an Apple Developer Academy Student at Brazil.


## About me
During my childhood, I hated veggies, and it was very hard for me to try them. Turns out, when I was 15 years old I
decided to become a vegetarian, and them I had to learn how to eat these food. This journey made me experiment I lot 
of different plates and vegetables, and this made me start likeing them. Now, veggies are one of the best part of my 
plates and I love them.

This app was made to represent how fun and delicious eating vegetables, fruits and greens can be. I think all people
should have the opportunity to really try vegetables mixed with delicious food.
