#  VeggieRecipe

## Hello! My name is Carolina Quiterio and I'm an Apple Developer Academy Student at Brazil.


## About me
During my childhood, I hated veggies, and it was very hard for me to try them, I even had gaps of some vitamins in 
my body. Turns out, when I was 15 years old I decided to become a vegetarian, and them I had to learn how to eat 
these food. This journey made me experiment I lot of different plates and vegetables, and this made me start likeing 
them. Now, veggies are one of the best part of my plates and I love them.

Another fact about me is that I love technology and Mobile Development.

Because of this, I decided to make a Playground App to show how fun and delicious eating vegetables, fruits and greens can be. 
I think all people should have the opportunity to really try vegetables mixed with delicious food.
