<a id="about-me"></a>
## 👩🏼‍💻 About me
During my childhood, I hated veggies, and it was very hard for me to try them, and I even had deficiencies in some vitamins in my body. It turns out that when I was 15 years old, I decided to become a vegetarian, so I had to learn how to eat vegetables. This decision made me experiment different plates and vegetables, and I began to like them. Now, veggies are one of the best parts of my meals, and I love them.

Because of this, I decided to combine three things that I love: 1. Veggies; 2. Technology; and 3. Mathematics. 
I then created VeggieMathics, a Playground App written in Swift that tells the story of Carol, a girl who needs help to collect vitamins and recipes of some veggies by solving math challenges. I made this Playground to help children, like myself, have the opportunity to truly experience the benefits of incorporating vegetables into their diet in a delicious way for a healthier lifestyle.
